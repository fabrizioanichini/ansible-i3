# Introduction

this process aim to restore my environment starting from a minimal installation of arch linux.


sudo dd if=/dev/zero of=/dev/nvme0n1 bs=1M status=progress

# Consideration on installation

I have used archinstall, made a partition with ext4, and added linux-firmware as additional package ( as arch wiki for Framwork Pc). 

# Requirements

You only need git and ansible package to get started.
